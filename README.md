# Notes:

**This project has two versions.**

---

## DEVCPP 5.11 Version  

- The file encoding for this version is uniformly set to **GBK and GB2312** (due to the presence of Chinese characters).  
- This version is built using the project system in **DEVCPP** and **does not support CMake**. Using mainstream editors like **VS Code** or IDEs like **CLion** and **Visual Studio** may result in garbled text or compilation errors.  
- This **.txt** files in this version may encounter reading errors or display garbled characters if opened in a non-GBK format.  
- Unless the school strictly requires using **DEVCPP** or other outdated IDEs for this library management project, **this version is not recommended**.  

---

## VSCode + CMake Version  

- The file encoding for this version is uniformly set to **UTF-8**.  
- This version can be opened and run in any program that supports **CMake**, such as **VS Code + CMake plugin, CLion, etc.**  
- It offers **better compatibility** and **a more convenient editing experience**.  
- The **DEVCPP 5.11** version may experience **garbled text issues** due to lack of support for **UTF-8 Chinese characters**. Additionally, **DEVCPP does not support CMake project builds and execution**, so **it is not recommended to open this version with DEVCPP 5.11**.  
- Newer versions of **DEVCPP** support **UTF-8** Chinese characters. If errors occur with another version, please download the correct one and manually build the project within DEV.

Working on this project has been quite fun! You can add your own features to this small project just like building blocks.  

Hope you all enjoy it. :)
